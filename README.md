# memory-game

A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Rules of Memory Game

- You will start by flipping over one card.
- If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score.
- These cards then disspear.
- If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert notifies you of this and the cards flip back.
The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.
